NOTE: This must be run on the 2012 R2 Preview: http://bit.ly/1cofnpt

Copy the modules to C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\PSDesiredStateConfiguration\PSProviders

Your folder should look like this now:
DhcpSettingDSC
DhcpV4ClassDSC
DhcpV4OptionDefinitionDSC
DhcpV4OptionValueDSC
DhcpV4ScopeDSC
DhcpV6ScopeDSC
MSFT_ArchiveResource
MSFT_EnvironmentResource
MSFT_GroupResource
MSFT_LogResource
MSFT_PackageResource
MSFT_ProcessResource
MSFT_RegistryResource
MSFT_RoleResource
MSFT_ScriptResource
MSFT_ServiceResource
MSFT_UserResource

Copy the SampleConfiguration and SampleData files to a working folder, I'll use c:\temp.

Run the following commands in PowerShell:
===========================
#Change to your work directory
cd c:\temp

#This creates a configuration command named DhcpServers (as defined in the file)
. .\SampleConfiguration.ps1

#This compiles a MOF file based on the DhcpServers configuration using the
#  values provided in SampleData.ps1
#  You will get a bunch of errors here because of the way I named my modules, but
#  the process will still work.  I've opened a connect bug for this here: http://bit.ly/19vvx46
DhcpServers -ConfigurationData (.\SampleData.ps1)

#This applies the configuration to the nodes defined in the configuration,
#  the sample files define only "localhost"
Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\DhcpServers | Wait-Job | Receive-Job
===========================

Now you can open the Dhcp management console and see all the scopes that were created.

Note that there is a limitation on the size of the MOF file that can be submitted (50kb?) and the sample configuration comes very close to this limit.  I'm not sure if there is a way to configure this maximum.
