================================================================================

This must be run locally on a 2012 DHCP server as the Powershell V4 DSC infrastructure
will provide all the remoting capability, so I didn't implement that as part
of this provider/testing framework.

If you have the Powershell V4 preview, look at Example_Powershell_V4.txt instead.

Configuration:

1.	Copy the Modules to one of the folders in $env:PsModulePath

2.	Put the FakeFramework.ps1, SampleConfiguration.ps1, and SampleConfigurationData.ps1
	  files together somewhere and change to that folder (eg c:\temp)

3.	Load the fake DSC framework by dot-sourcing FakeFramework.ps1:

	. .\FakeFramework.ps1

4.	Load the configuration function by dot-sourcing SampleConfiguration.ps1:

	. .\SampleConfiguration.ps1

5.	Set your debug preference so you can see what is going on:

	$DebugPreference = "continue"

6.	Attempt to apply the configuration to the computer:

	DhcpServers -ConfigurationData (.\SampleConfigurationData.ps1)

7.	This will do nothing, unless your computer is named "DhcpServer1".
	  Edit SampleConfigurationData.ps1 and change one of the computer
	  names at the end to match your computer name.  It must be 2012
	  and already have the DhcpServer and RSAT-Dhcp roles installed.

8.	Now re-apply the configuration and it should apply the sample data
	  to your computer:

	DhcpServers -ConfigurationData (.\SampleConfigurationData.ps1)

9.	After it configures DHCP, you can go in and mess things up and then
	  re-rapply the configuration (#8) and it will fix it all back. Note
	  that it only controls the settings that are explicitly configured
	  in SampleConfigurationData and SampleConfiguration, so if something
	  else is changed, it won't be set back.

10.	You can also add a subnet with a scope ID of 10.0.104.0 and the sample
	  configuration will delete it for you.
