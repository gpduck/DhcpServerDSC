================================================================================

This must be run on a DHCP server as the Powershell V4 DSC infrastructure
will provide all the remoting capability, so I didn't implement that as part
of this provider.

If you have the Powershell V4 preview, look at Example_Powershell_V4.txt instead.

Configuration:

1.	Copy the Module to one of the folders in $env:PsModulePath

2. 	Put the ApplyConfiguraion.ps1 and Configuration.ps1 files in a folder
	  together and change to that folder

3. 	Edit Configuration.ps1 to contain the DHCP scope info you want to
   	create/modify.

4.	Run the following command to apply the configuration:
  	
		.\DhcpScopeConfiguration.ps1 | Foreach-Object {
	 		.\ApplyConfiguration.ps1 -ProviderName DhcpV4ScopeDSC -Configuration $_
	 	}

5.	You can also import the provider directly and play with the 3 commands in it:
   	
		Import-Module DhcpV4ScopeDSC
	 	.\DhcpScopeConfiguration.ps1 | Foreach-Object {
			Test-TargetResource @_
		}
		
		Get-TargetResource -ScopeId 10.10.10.0

		.\DhcpScopeConfiguration.ps1 | Foreach-Object {
			Set-TargetResource @_
		}
		
6.	There is also debug information that is output when the module makes a
		change to the DHCP configuration:
		
		$DebugPreference = "continue"
		.\DhcpScopeConfiguration.ps1 | Foreach-Object {
	 		.\ApplyConfiguration.ps1 -ProviderName DhcpV4ScopeDSC -Configuration $_
	 	}
		
		You can edit your DHCP configuration to make some of the properties not
		match and see that only the incorrect settings are changed when the module
		is run.
		
7.	To delete the subnets, create a configuration that specifies the required
		parameters along with Ensure = "Absent" and re-apply the configuration.
